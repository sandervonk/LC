## Q1: Acceleration and Velocity Vectors
### Question:
> If the acceleration vector of an object is zero, its velocity vector
> - [ ] can change length but cannot turn
> - [ ] is also zero
> - [x] is not changing
> - [ ] can turn but cannot change in length

### Reasoning:
By Newton's first law of motion (inertia), "an object in motion tends to stay in motion unless an external force acts upon it"

As an extension of this idea, a physics body's velocity (state of motion) will stay constant unless acted upon by an external force

Force is equal to the product of mass and acceleration ($F = m*a$), and as a result, with any 0 acceleration, it is impossible for there to be any force excreted on the object.

Since there is no external force working on the object (since the acceleration vector is zero), its velocity will remain changed / **is not changing**.

## Q2: Circling Airplane
### Question:
> A line-controlled model airplane is propelled by a small gasoline engine and propeller and flies in a circle at the end of its control lines. Its acceleration vector points
> - [ ] in its direction of motion.
> - [ ] opposite to its direction of motion.
> - [x] in the direction of the person holding the control lines.
> - [ ] away from the person holding the control lines.

### Reasoning:
For an object to stay remain in circular motion, it must have a centripetal force, a "force that makes a body follow a curved path." 

For this path to remain circular, it must have a centripetal acceleration of $a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$. Though this equation is unimportant for this question, it is very helpful to know that the direction of the acceleration must be towards the center of the circle.

As a result, in this instance, since the model airplane is following a circular path, its acceleration vector must be pointing towards the center of the circle - **in the direction of the person holding the control lines**.

## Q3: Banking Automobile
### Question:
> An automobile enters a $40.0°$ curve with a speed of $46.0 \, \frac{\text m}{\text s}$ and emerges from this curve $11.0 \, \text s$ later with the same speed. What is the magnitude of the average acceleration during this time interval?
(in $\frac{\text m}{\text s^2}$)

### Variable Breakdown
> $\Theta_i = 0.0°$
> >
> $\Theta_f = 40.0°$

> $|\vec v_i| = 46.0 \, \frac{\text m}{\text s}$
>>
> $|\vec v_f| = 46.0 \, \frac{\text m}{\text s}$

> $\Delta t = 11.0 \, \text s$

### Steps / Summary
#### Setting up the vector
In order to make this problem a tiny bit easier to comprehend, we'll be setting up velocity vectors for the initial and final velocities ($\vec v_i$ and $\vec v_f$) in the format:
> $\vec A \ = \ <A_x, \, A_y>$

For our velocity vectors, we can rewrite the $\Theta$ angle and $|\vec v|$ magnitudes in this form using some basic trig:
> $\vec v = <v_x, \, v_y>$
> >
> $\vec v = <\cos{\Theta} * v_x \, \sin{\Theta} * v_y>$

$\vec v_i = <\cos{\Theta_i} * |\vec v_{i}|, \, \sin{\Theta_i} * |\vec v_{i}|>$

$\vec v_f = <\cos{\Theta_f} * |\vec v_{f}|, \, \sin{\Theta_f} * |\vec v_{f}|>$

#### Finding the vector for change in velocity
To find the vector $\Delta \vec v$, we can simply use:

$\Delta \vec v = \vec v_f - \vec v_i$

and substitute in the values that we just found to get:

$\Delta \vec v = <
\cos{\Theta_f} * |\vec v_{f}| - \cos{\Theta_i} * |\vec v_{i}|
, \, 
\sin{\Theta_f} * |\vec v_{f}| - \cos{\Theta_i} * |\vec v_{i}| >$

#### Solving for acceleration
To find the magnitude of the acceleration vector $|\vec a|$, we can use the definition:

$\vec a = \frac{\Delta \vec v}{\Delta t}$

$|\vec a| = \frac{|\Delta \vec v|}{\Delta t}$

and substitute in the magnitude of a vector $\vec A$ using the Pythagorean theorem:

> $|\vec A| = \sqrt{
	{\left(
		A_{x}
	\right)^2}
	+
	{\left(
		A_{y}
	\right)^2}
}$

which with our change in velocity vector $\Delta \vec v$ becomes:
 
 $|\Delta \vec v| = \sqrt{
	{\left(
		v_{f,x} - v_{i,x}
	\right)^2}
	+
	{\left(
		v_{f,y} - v_{i,y}
	\right)^2}
}$

$|\Delta \vec v| = \sqrt{
	{\left(
		\cos{\Theta_f} * |\vec v_{f}| - \cos{\Theta_i} * |\vec v_{i}|
	\right)^2}
	+
	{\left(
		\sin{\Theta_f} * |\vec v_{f}| - \cos{\Theta_i} * |\vec v_{i}|
	\right)^2}
}$

which gets substituted back in for the magnitude of deceleration:

$|\vec a| = \frac{|\Delta \vec v|}{\Delta t}$

$|\vec a| = \frac
{\sqrt{
	{\left(
		\cos{\Theta_f} * |\vec v_{f}| - \cos{\Theta_i} * |\vec v_{i}|
	\right)^2}
	+
	{\left(
		\sin{\Theta_f} * |\vec v_{f}| - \cos{\Theta_i} * |\vec v_{i}|
	\right)^2}
}}
{\Delta t}$

It might not be pretty, but it works!

For my example problem, this works out to:
> $|\Delta \vec v| = \sqrt{
	{\left(
		\cos{\Theta_f} * |\vec v_{f}| - \cos{\Theta_i} * |\vec v_{i}|
	\right)^2}
	+
	{\left(
		\sin{\Theta_f} * |\vec v_{f}| - \cos{\Theta_i} * |\vec v_{i}|
	\right)^2}
}$
>>
> $|\Delta \vec v| = {46.0 \, \frac{\text m}{\text s}} * \sqrt{
	{\left(
		\cos{40.0°} - \cos{0.0°}
	\right)^2}
	+
	{\left(
		\sin{40.0°} - \sin{0.0°}
	\right)^2}
}$
>>
> $|\Delta \vec v| \approx 31.466 \, \frac{\text m}{\text s^2}$
>>
> $|\vec a| = \frac{|\Delta \vec v|}{\Delta t}$
>>
> $|\vec a| \approx \frac{31.466 \, \frac{\text m}{\text s^2}}{11.0 \, \text s}$
>>
> $|\vec a| \approx 2.861 \, \frac{\text m}{\text s^2}$

Giving me a final answer of `2.861 m/s^2`

## Q4: Accelerating vector particle
### Question:
> A particle moves in the $x$-$y$ plane with a constant acceleration of $\vec a$ = ( $-1.92 \hat i$ + $2.76 \hat j$ ) $\text m / \text s^2$. 
> >
> The velocity at time $t = 0 \, \text s$ is $\vec v$ = ( $4.26 \hat i$ - $5.49 \hat j$ ) $\text m / \text s^2$. 
> >

> >
> $\vec v_f = <?, \, ?>$

> $t_i = 0 \, \text s$
> >
> $t_f = 6 \, \text s$

### Steps / Summary

To complete this question, we can make use of the equation:

$\vec v_f = \vec v_i + \vec a * t$

Which can also be applied infividually to each component:

$<v_{f, x}, \, v_{f, y}> \ = \ <v_{i, x}, \, v_{i, y}> + <a_x * t, \, a_y*t>$

$<v_{f, x}, \, v_{f, y}> \ = \ <v_{i, x}, \, v_{i, y}> + <a_x * t, \, a_y*t>$

$<v_{f, x}, \, v_{f, y}> \ = \ <v_{i, x} + a_x * t, \, v_{i, y} + a_y * t>$

For my example problem, this works out to:
> $<v_{f, x}, \, v_{f, y}> \ = \ <4.26 + -1.92*6, \, -5.49 + 2.76 * 6>$
> >
> $<v_{f, x}, \, v_{f, y}> \ = \ <-7.26, \, 11.07>$
> >
> $v_f \ = \ \left( -7.26i + 11.07j \right) * \left( \frac{\text m}{\text s}\right)$


## Q5: Moving particle
### Question:
> A particle moves in the $x-y$ plane with constant acceleration. At time $t = 0 \, s$, the position vector for the particle is $\vec r = <1.30 \, m, \, 1.80 \, m>$. The acceleration is given by the vector 
$\vec a = <3.20 \, \frac{m}{s^2}, \ 6.40 \, \frac{m}{s^2}>$. The velocity vector at time $t = 0 \, s$ is $\vec v = <10.00 \, \frac{m}{s} − 6.10 \, \frac{m}{s}>$.
> - Find the magnitude of the velocity vector at time $t = 2.80 \, s$.
(in m/s)
> - What is the angle between the velocity vector and the positive x-axis at time $t = 2.80 \, s$? (in $deg$)
> - What is the magnitude of the position vector at time $t = 2.80 \, s$? (in $m$) 
> - What is the angle between the position vector and the positive x-axis at time $t = 2.80 \, s$? (in $deg$)

### Variable Breakdown
> $t \ = \ 2.80 \, s$

 > $\vec r_i \ = \ <1.30 \, m, \, 1.80 \, m>$

> $\vec v_i \ = \ <10.00 \, \frac{m}{s}, \ − 6.10 \, \frac{m}{s}>$

> $\vec a = <3.20 \, \frac{m}{s^2}, \ 6.40 \, \frac{m}{s^2}>$

### Steps / Summary
#### Setup: Velocity vector at end time
To find the final velocity vector, we can use the equation

$\vec v_f = \vec v_i + \vec a * t$

For my example problem, this looks like:
> $\vec v_f \ = \ \vec v_i + \vec a * t$
> >
> $\vec v_f \ = \ <10.00 \, \frac{m}{s}, \ − 6.10 \, \frac{m}{s}> + <3.20 \, \frac{m}{s^2}, \ 6.40 \, \frac{m}{s^2}> * \ 2.80 \, s$
> >
> $\vec v_f \ = \ <18.96 \, \frac{m}{s}, \ − 11.82 \, \frac{m}{s}>$

#### Setup: Position vector at end time

And for the final position vector, we can use the equation:

$\vec r_f = \vec r_i + \vec v_i * t + \frac{1}{2} * \vec a * t^2$

which is just a vectorized version of the kinematics equation:

$r_f = r_i + v_o*t + \frac{1}{2}*a*t^2$

For my example problem, this looks like:
> $\vec r_f \ = \ \vec r_i + \vec v_i * t + \frac{1}{2} * \vec a * t^2$
> >
> $\vec r_f \ = \ <1.30 \, m, \, 1.80 \, m> + \ <10.00 \, \frac{m}{s}, \ − 6.10 \, \frac{m}{s}> \ * \ 2.80 \, s + \frac{1}{2} * \ <3.20 \, \frac{m}{s^2}, \ 6.40 \, \frac{m}{s^2}> \ * \left( 2.80 \, s \right)^2$
> >
> $\vec r_f \ = \ <{ 41.844 } \, m, \ { 9.808 } \, m >$

#### Part 1: Magnitude

To find the magnitude of a vector $\vec A$, we can use the formula:

$|\vec A| = \sqrt{\left(A_x\right)^2 + \left(A_y\right)^2}$

We can apply this to both the final velocity and position vectors we found in the **Setup** in order to complete parts *1* and *3*:

$|\vec v_f| = \sqrt{\left(v_{f,x}\right)^2 + \left(v_{f,y}\right)^2}$

$|\vec r_f| = \sqrt{\left(r_{f,x}\right)^2 + \left(r_{f,y}\right)^2}$

##### Magnitude of Velocity
To solve for magnitude of velocity, we simply use what we found in the setup and plug it into:

$|\vec v_f| = \sqrt{\left(v_{f,x}\right)^2 + \left(v_{f,y}\right)^2}$

For my example problem, this works out to:
> $|\vec v_f| = \sqrt{\left(v_{f,x}\right)^2 + \left(v_{f,y}\right)^2}$
> >
> $|\vec v_f| = \sqrt{\left(18.96 \, \frac{m}{s}\right)^2 + \left(-11.82 \, \frac{m}{s}\right)^2}$
> >
> $|\vec v_f| = 22.343 \, \frac{m}{s}$

Giving me a velocity magnitude of `22.343 m/s`

##### Magnitude of Position

To solve for the magnitude of the position vector, we just use the Pythagorean theorem with the $r_x$ and $r_y$ values we found before:

$|\vec r_f| = \sqrt{\left(r_{f,x}\right)^2 + \left(r_{f,y}\right)^2}$

For my example problem, this works out to:
> $|\vec r_f| = \sqrt{\left(r_{f,x}\right)^2 + \left(r_{f,y}\right)^2}$
> >
> $|\vec r_f| = \sqrt{\left(41.844 \, m \right)^2 + \left(9.808 \, m \right)^2}$
>>
> $|\vec r_f| = 42.978$

Giving me a position vector magnitude of `42.978 m`

#### Part 2: Angles

To find the angle of a vector relative to the $x$-axis, we can use the equation:

$\Theta = tan^{-1}{\frac{A_y}{A_x}}$

And then increment / decrement the resulting $\Theta$ by intervals of 90 degrees if needed to adjust for the range of the inverse tangent function.

##### Angle of Velocity Vector
To find the angle of the velocity vector, we use the equations we found before for the angle of a vector relative to the positive $x$-axis

$\Theta = tan^{-1}{\frac{A_y}{A_x}}$

$\Theta = tan^{-1}{\frac{v_{f, y}}{v_{f, x}}}$

For my example problem this works out to:
> $\Theta = tan^{-1}{\frac{v_{f, y}}{v_{f, x}}}$
> >
> $\Theta = tan^{-1}{-\frac{11.82}{18.96}}$
> >
> $\Theta = -31.94°$
> >
> This angle is in $-90°< \Theta < 0°$, which means that it's already in the correct quadrant (+, -), and does not need to be corrected
> >
> Also, it's asking for the absolute value of the angle between, or at least that's what works

Giving me a final velocity angle of `31.94°`

##### Angle of Position Vector
To find the angle of the position vector, we again use the inverse tangent function

$\Theta = tan^{-1}{\frac{A_y}{A_x}}$

$\Theta = tan^{-1}{\frac{r_{f, y}}{r_{f, x}}}$

For my example problem this works out to:
> $\Theta = tan^{-1}{\frac{r_{f, y}}{r_{f, x}}}$
> >
> $\Theta = tan^{-1}{\frac{9.808}{41.844}}$
>>
> $\Theta = 13.19°$> 
> >
> This angle is in $0°< \Theta < 90°$, which means that it's already in the correct quadrant (+, +), and does not need to be corrected
> >
> Note that you might have to use the absolute value of this angle, I'm not quite sure after the previous part

Giving me a final position angle of `13.19°`

## Q6: Car Stunt
### Question:
> An unoccupied car is sent off the top of a cliff during a movie scene. The car is moving at $57.41 \, km/hr$ at the instant it leaves the cliff. The cliff is $62.15 \, m$ high.
How long is the car in the air? (in $s$) 

### Variable Breakdown
> $v_{x,i} = 57.41 \, km/hr$
> >
> $v_{x,i} = 15.947 \, m/s$

> $\Delta y = -62.15 \, m$

> $t = ?$

### Steps / Summary
#### Finding time
to find the time spent in the air, we can solve for time in the kinematics equation, knowing that we have no initial vertical velocity:

$\Delta y = v_{x,i}*t + \frac{1}{2}*a*t^2$

$\Delta y = \frac{1}{2}*a*t^2$

$t = \sqrt{\frac{2 * \Delta y}{-g}}$

Which for my example problem works out to:
> $t = \sqrt{\frac{2 * \Delta y}{-g}}$
> >
> $t = \sqrt{\frac{2 * {-62.15 \, m}}{-9.8 \, m/s^2}}$
> >
> $t = 3.5614 \, s$

Giving me a solution of `3.5614 s` for this part

#### Finding distance travelled
To find the distance travelled by the car over this time, we can simply use the equation:

$\Delta x = v * t$

$\Delta x = v_{x,i} * t$

Which for my example problem works out to:

> $\Delta x = v_{x,i} * t$
> >
> $\Delta x = \left( 15.947 \, m/s \right) * \left( 3.5614 \, s \right)$
> >
> $\Delta x = 56.794 \, m$

Giving me a final solution of `56.794 m`

## Q7: Angled projectile
### Question:
> A projectile is fired at $42.5°$ above the horizontal. Its initial speed is equal to $32.5 \, m/s$. Assume that the free-fall acceleration is constant throughout and that the effects of the air can be ignored. 
> - What is the maximum height reached by the projectile? (in $m$)
> - At what time after being fired does the projectile reach this maximum height? (in $s$)

### Variable Breakdown
> $\Theta = 42.5°$

> $v_i = 32.5 \, m/s$

### Steps / Summary
#### Setup: velocity components
To find the y-component of velocity (the only one important to this question), we can use trigonometry to find $v_{i,y}$:

$v_{i,y} = \sin{\Theta} * v_i$

#### Part 2: Time
The maximum height will be reached when velocity is 0, at the top of its arc. To find when the velocity is 0, we can use the equation:

$v = v_i + a * t$

where acceleration is the downwards acceleration of gravity, and we only care about the y-component:

$0 \, m/s = v_{i,y} + \left( -9.8 \, m/s \right) * t$

$t = \frac{v_{i,y}}{9.8 \, m/s}$

$t = \frac{\sin{\Theta} * v_i}{9.8 \, m/s}$

For my example problem, this works out to:
> $t = \frac{\sin{\Theta} * v_i}{9.8 \, m/s}$
> >
> $t = \frac{\sin{42.5°} \ * \ 32.5 \, m/s}{9.8 \, m/s}$
> >
> $t = 2.240 \, s$

Giving me a solution of `2.240 s`

#### Part 1: Maximum height

Now that we know when it reaches the maximum height, we can use a kinematics equation to find the max $y$.

$y_{max} = y_i + v_{y,i} *t + \frac{1}{2}*a*t^2$

$y_{max} = \sin{\Theta} * v_i *t + \frac{1}{2}*\left( -9.8 \, m/s^2 \right)*t^2$

For my example problem, I can plug in my $t$ to get:
> $y_{max} = \sin{\Theta} * v_i *t + \frac{1}{2}*\left( -9.8 \, m/s^2 \right)*t^2$
>>
> $y_{max} = \left( \sin{42.5°} \ * \ 32.5 \, m/s \right) *t + \frac{1}{2}*\left( -9.8 \, m/s^2 \right)*t^2$e
> >
> $y_{max} = 24.597 \, m$

Giving me a final solution of `24.596 m`

## Q8: Short Ball Thrower
### Question:
> A person who is $1 \, m$ tall throws a ball horizontally with a speed of $3.7 \, m/s$. What is the speed of the ball the moment before it strikes the ground (in $m/s$)?

### Variable Breakdown
> $y_i = 1.0 \, m$

> $v_x = 3.7 \, m/s$

### Steps / Summary

We can reuse the equation for an object to hit the ground a distance $\Delta y$ away with a $v_y$ of $0$ :

$t = \sqrt{\frac{2 * \Delta y}{-g}}$

then substitute that into the equation for final velocity:

$v_f = v_i + a * t$

$v_{y.f} = v_{y,i} + \left( -9.8 \, m/s^2 \right) * t$

$v_{y.f} = \left( -9.8 \, m/s^2 \right) * \sqrt{\frac{2 * \Delta y}{-9.8 \, m/s^2}}$

and use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the final velocity (speed):

$|\vec v| = \sqrt{\left( v_x  \right)^2 + \left( v_{y,f}  \right)^2}$

$|\vec v| = \sqrt{\left( v_x  \right)^2 + \left( v_{y,f}  \right)^2}$

$|\vec v| = \sqrt{\left( v_x  \right)^2 + \left( 
\left( -9.8 \, m/s^2 \right) * \sqrt{\frac{2 * \Delta y}{-9.8 \, m/s^2}} \,
  \right)^2}$

Which for my example problem works out to:
> $|\vec v| = \sqrt{\left( v_x  \right)^2 + \left( 
\left( -9.8 \, m/s^2 \right) * \sqrt{\frac{2 * \Delta y}{-9.8 \, m/s^2}} \,
  \right)^2}$
> >
> $|\vec v| = \sqrt{\left( 3.7 \, m/s  \right)^2 + \left( 
\left( -9.8 \, m/s^2 \right) * \sqrt{\frac{2 * -1 \, m}{-9.8 \, m/s^2}} \,
  \right)^2}$
 >>
 > $|\vec v|  = 5.770 \, m/s$

Giving me a final answer of `5.770 m/s`


## Q9: More short "people" throwing balls
### Question:
> A person who is $1.2 \, m$ tall throws a ball with a speed of $6 \, m/s$ at an angle of $30°$ above the horizontal. What are the $x$ and $y$ components of the velocity (in m/s) of the ball the instant before it strikes the ground? The acceleration due to gravity is $9.81 \, m/s^2$
> - What is the $x$-component
> - What is the $y$-component

### Variable Breakdown
> $g = 9.81 \, m/s^2$

> $\Theta = 30°$

> $v_i = 6.0 \, m/s$

> $\Delta y = -1.2 \, m$

### Steps / Summary
To solve this question, we use a similar process to **Q8**, except with a couple complications.

#### Setup
To get started, we'll use some trig to find the components of the initial velocity:

$v_{i,x} = v_i * \cos{\Theta}$

$v_{i,y} = v_i * \sin{\Theta}$

now we'll be able to use these in place of the components in later equations

#### Actual Solving
To find the final vertical velocity $v_{f,y}$, we can use the equation:

$v^2 = v_i^2 + 2*a*\Delta y$

$v_{f,y}^2 = v_{i,y}^2 + 2*-g*\Delta y$

and solve for $v_{f,y}$:

$|v_{f,y}| = \sqrt{\left( v_i * \sin{\Theta} \right)^2 + 2*\left( -9.81 \, m/s \right)*\Delta y}$

For my example problem, this would work out to:
> $|v_{f,y}| = \sqrt{\left( v_i * \sin{\Theta} \right)^2 + 2*\left( -9.81 \, m/s \right)*\Delta y}$
> >
> $|v_{f,y}| = \sqrt{\left( \left( 6.0 \, m/s \right) * \sin{30°} \right)^2 + 2*\left( -9.81 \, m/s \right)* -1.2 \, m}$
> >
> $|v_{f,y}| = 5.705 \, m/s$
> >
> now we just have to correct this, to **account for the fact that the direction of the velocity is lost**

Giving me a final $y$-component of `-5.705 m/s`

#### Finishing up

Don't forget to add our $v_x$ component from before, ($v_i * \cos{\Theta}$)

For my example problem, this works out to:
> $v_x = v_{i,x}$
> >
> $v_x = v_i * \cos{\Theta}$
> >
> $v_x = \left( 6.0 \, m/s \right) * \cos{30°}$
> >
> $v_x = 5.196 \, m/s$

Giving me an $x$-component of `5.196 m/s`
