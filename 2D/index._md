## Q1: Helicopter Package
### Question:
> A helicopter is flying in a straight line over a level field at a constant speed of $6.6 \,m/s$ and at a constant altitude of $15.5 \, m$. A package is ejected horizontally from the helicopter with an initial speed of $14.6 \, m/s$ relative to the helicopter, and a direction opposite to the helicopter's motion. 
> - Find the initial speed of the package relative to the ground. (in $m/s$)
> - What is the horizontal distance between the helicopter and the package at the instant that the package strikes the ground? (in $m$)
> - What angle between $0°$ and $90°$ does the velocity vector of the package make with the ground at the instant before impact, as seen from the ground? (in deg)

### Variable Breakdown
>

> $v_{g,h} = 6.6 \, m/s$
> >
> $v_{h,p} = -14.6 \, m/s$

> $y = 15.5 \, m$

### Steps / Summary

#### Part 1: Package-Ground Velocity
To find the initial speed of the velocity $|v_{g,p}|$, we can use the equation:

$v_{a,c} = v_{a,b} + v_{b,c}$

$|v_{g,p}| = |v_{g,h} + v_{h,p}|$

For my example problem, this works out to:
> $|v_{g,p}| = |v_{g,h} + v_{h,p}|$
> >
> $|v_{g,p}| = |\left( 6.6 \, m/s \right) + \left( -14.6 \, m/s \right)|$
> >
> $|v_{g,p}| = |-8 \, m/s|$
> >
> $|v_{g,p}| = 8 \, m/s$

Giving me a final answer of `8.00 m/s`

#### Part 2: Relative Package Distance
To find the horizontal distance $s_{h,p}$ travelled relative to the helicopter, we can use the equation:

$t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}$

$t = \sqrt{\frac{2 * y}{9.8 \, m/s^2}}$

and substitute it into

$s = |v| * t$

$s_{h,p} = |v_{h,p}| * t$

to get

$s_{h,p} = |v_{h,p}| * \sqrt{\frac{2 * y}{9.8 \, m/s^2}}$

For my example problem, this would work out to:
> $s_{h,p} = |v_{h,p}| * \sqrt{\frac{2 * y}{9.8 \, m/s^2}}$
> >
> $s_{h,p} = |-14.6 \, m/s| * \sqrt{\frac{2 * 15.5 \, m}{9.8 \, m/s^2}}$
> >
> $s_{h,p} = 25.967 \, m$

Giving me a final distance of `25.967 m`

#### Part 3: Angle of package
To find the angle $\Theta$ between the ground and velocity vector of the package $v_{g,p}$, we can 

To solve this part, we'll use trig on the velocity between the ground and package $v_{g,p}$ we found earlier in order to find the angle.

$\Theta = \tan^{-1}{\left( \frac{v_y}{v_x} \right)}$

$\Theta = \tan^{-1}{\left( \frac{v_{g,p,y}}{v_{g,p}} \right)}$

$\Theta = \tan^{-1}{\left( \frac{v_{p,y}}{v_{g,p}} \right)}$


and substitute in the $v_{p,y}$:

$v = a*t$

$v_{p,y} = -g * t$

$v_{p,y} = \left( -9.8 \, m/s^2 \right) * \sqrt{\frac{2 * y}{9.8 \, m/s^2}}$

$\Theta = \tan^{-1}{\left( \frac{\left( -9.8 \, m/s^2 \right) * \sqrt{\frac{2 * y}{9.8 \, m/s^2}}}{|v_{g,h} + v_{h,p}|} \right)}$

For my example problem, this would work out to
> $\Theta = \tan^{-1}{\left( \frac{\left( -9.8 \, m/s^2 \right) * \sqrt{\frac{2 * y}{9.8 \, m/s^2}}}{|v_{g,h} + v_{h,p}|} \right)}$
> >
> $\Theta = \tan^{-1}{\left( \frac{\left( -9.8 \, m/s^2 \right) * \sqrt{\frac{2 * 15.5 \, m }{9.8 \, m/s^2}}}{-8 \, m/s} \right)}$
> >
> $\Theta = 65.35°$

Giving me a final angle of `65.35°`

## Q2: Train Ball Toss
### Question:
> A train is travelling east along a straight run of track at $59.0 \, km/hr$. Inside, two siblings $2.0 \, m$ apart are playing catch directly across the aisle. The kid wearing a Tragically Hip T-shirt throws the ball horizontally north. The ball crosses the train and is caught $0.80 \, s$ later by her little brother. (Ignore any effects of gravity or friction.) 
> - Find the magnitude of the ball's velocity from the little brother's point of view. (in $m/s$)
> - What is the magnitude of the velocity of the ball as seen by someone standing still outside the train? (in $m/s$)
> - What is the angle between the direction of the ball and the direction of the train as measured by someone standing still outside the train? (in $deg$)

### Variable Breakdown
> $d = 2.0 \, m$

> $v_{g,t} = 59.0 \, km/hr$
> >
> $v_{g,t} = 16.389 \, m/s$

### Steps / Summary
#### Part 1: Magnitude of Ball's Velocity as Little Brother
For this part of the question, since both the subjects are inside the train, we can forget about the train's movement, and just use:

$|v| = \frac{|d|}{t}$

$|v_{train, ball}| = \frac{|d_{train, ball}|}{t}$

For my example problem, this works out to:
> $|v_{train, ball}| = \frac{|d_{bro, ball}|}{t}$
> >
> $|v_{train, ball}| = \frac{|2.0\, m|}{0.80 \, s}$
> >
> $|v_{train, ball}| = 2.5 \, m/s$

Giving me a magnitude of `2.50 m/s` for this part

#### Part 2: 
To find the velocity as observed from outside the train, we can use the same relationship as before:

$\vec v_{a,c} = \vec v_{a,b} + \vec v_{b,c}$

$\vec v_{track, ball} = \vec v_{track, train} + \vec v_{train, ball}$

$|\vec v_{track, ball}| = \sqrt{
\left( 
	v_{track, train, x} v_{train, ball,x} 
\right)^2
+ 
\left( 
	v_{track, train, y} v_{train, ball,y}
\right)^2
}$

If we consider the motion of the ball to be along the x-axis, and the motion of the train as being along the y-axis, we can rewrite this as:

$|\vec v_{track, ball}| = \sqrt{
	|\vec v_{train, ball}|^2
		+ 
	|\vec v_{track, train}|^2
}$

Then substitute in $|\vec v_{train, ball}|$ as found in the previous part

$|\vec v_{track, ball}| = \sqrt{
	\left( 
		\frac{|d_{train, ball}|}{t}
	 \right)^2
		+ 
	|\vec v_{track, train}|^2
}$

For my example problem this works out to:
> $|\vec v_{track, ball}| = \sqrt{
	\left( 
		 2.50 \, m/s
	 \right)^2
		+ 
	|16.389 \, m/s|^2
}$
>>
> $|\vec v_{track, ball}| = 16.579 \, m/s$

Giving me an external magnitude of `16.579 m/s`

#### Part 3: Angle of Travel
To find the angle $\Theta$ at which the ball appeared to move relative to the train, we can use the equation:

$\Theta = \tan^{-1}{\left(\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} \right)}$

Since the track of the train becomes the base of this triangle as per the problem text *"what is the angle between the direction of the ball and the direction of the train"*, the opposite side would be what we called the x-axis, perpendicular to the motion of the train, and the adjacent side would be the base of the triangle:

$\Theta = \tan^{-1}{\left(\frac{|\vec v_{train, ball}|}{|\vec v_{track, train}|} \right)}$

$\Theta = \tan^{-1}{\left(\frac{|\vec v_{train, ball}|}{|\vec v_{track, train}|} \right)}$

Which we can subsitute our earlier value into

$\Theta = \tan^{-1}{\left(\frac{\frac{|d_{train, ball}|}{t}}{|\vec v_{track, train}|} \right)}$

For my example problem this works out to:
> $\Theta = \tan^{-1}{\left(\frac{\frac{|d_{train, ball}|}{t}}{|\vec v_{track, train}|} \right)}$
>>
> $\Theta = \tan^{-1}{\left(\frac{|2.50 \, m/s|}{|16.389 \, m/s|} \right)}$
> >
> $\Theta = 8.673°$

Giving me a final angle solution of `8.67°`

## Q3: Cessna Citation Flight
### Question:
> A CESSNA Citation attains an airspeed of $540 \, km/hr$. The plane sets out for a destination $1107 \, km$ to the north (a $0°$ course) but discovers that the plane must be headed $20°$ east of north to fly there directly. The plane arrives in $2.00 \, hr$.
> - What is the wind speed?
(in km/hr)
> - What is the direction of the wind? Give your answer in ° where 
>   - North = $0°$
>   - East = $90°$
>   - South = $180°$
>   - West = $270°$

### Variable Breakdown
Note that these are converted into the $x$-$y$ coordinate plane where due East is the $x$-axis, and $\Theta = 0°$ on the $x$-axis, and increases as we rotate counterclockwise.

> $|\vec d_{g,p}| = 1107.0 \, km$

> $t = 2.00 \, hr$

> $|\vec v_{a,p}| = 240 \, km/hr$
> >
> $\Theta_{a,p} = 70°$

> $\Theta_{g.p} = 90°$

### Steps / Summary
Please note the meaning of the subscripts is as follows
- $a$ - air
- $p$ - plane
- $g$ - ground

And:
- $\vec v_{g,p}$ - groundspeed / ground vector
- $\vec v_{g,a}$ - windspeed / wind vector
- $\vec v_{a,p}$ - airspeed / air vector

#### Finding the Vector
To find the vector representation of the wind, we can use the formula from the previous questions:

$v_{a,c} = v_{a,b} + v_{b,c}$

And amend it to use our subscripts

$\vec v_{g,p} = \vec v_{g,a} + \vec v_{a,p}$

Which can then be integrated with our velocity equation for the plane's average velocity, based on how long it took to reach the destination

$\vec v = \frac{\vec d}{t}$

$\vec v_{g,p} = \frac{\vec d_{g,p}}{t}$

$\frac{\vec d_{g,p}}{t} = \vec v_{g,a} + \vec v_{a,p}$

And solve for the air vector $\vec v_{g,a}$:

 $\vec v_{g,a} =  \frac{\vec d_{g,p}}{t} - \vec v_{a,p}$

And write out the vectors in terms of their direction and magnitude components that were given:
 
 $\vec v_{g,a} = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
	\frac{|\vec d_{a,p}|*\cos{\Theta_{g,p}}}{t}
	\\
	\frac{|\vec d_{a,p}|*\sin{\Theta_{g,p}}}{t}
\end{bmatrix} -
\begin{bmatrix}
	|\vec v_{a,p}|*\cos{\Theta_{a,p}}
	\\
	|\vec v_{a,p}|*\sin{\Theta_{a,p}}
\end{bmatrix}$

 $\vec v_{g,a} = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
		\frac{|\vec d_{a,p}|*\cos{\Theta_{g,p}}}{t} -
		|\vec v_{a,p}|*\cos{\Theta_{a,p}}
	\\
		\frac{|\vec d_{a,p}|*\sin{\Theta_{g,p}}}{t} -
		|\vec v_{a,p}|*\sin{\Theta_{a,p}}
\end{bmatrix}$

For my example problem, this looks like:
>   $\vec v_{g,a} = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
		\frac{|\vec d_{a,p}|*\cos{\Theta_{g,p}}}{t} -
		|\vec v_{a,p}|*\cos{\Theta_{a,p}}
	\\
		\frac{|\vec d_{a,p}|*\sin{\Theta_{g,p}}}{t} -
		|\vec v_{a,p}|*\sin{\Theta_{a,p}}
\end{bmatrix}$
>>
>  $\vec v_{g,a} = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
		\frac{\left(  1107.0 \, km  \right)*\cos{90°}}{2.00 \, hr} -
		\left(  540 \, km/hr  \right)*\cos{70°}
	\\
		\frac{\left(  1107.0 \, km  \right)*\sin{90°}}{2.00 \, hr} -
		\left(  540 \, km/hr  \right)*\sin{70°}
\end{bmatrix}$
>>
> $\vec v_{g,a} = \begin{bmatrix}
-184.691 \, km/hr
\\
46.066 \, km/hr
\end{bmatrix}$

#### Part 1: Magnitude
To find the magnitude of the air vector $|\vec v_{g,a}|$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:

$|\vec A| = \sqrt{\left( A_x \right)^2 + \left( A_y \right)^2}$

$|\vec v_{g,a}| = \sqrt{\left( v_{ga,x} \right)^2 + \left( v_{ga,y} \right)^2}$

And plug in the vector components we found in the previous part.  

For my example problem, this looks like:
> $|\vec v_{g,a}| = \sqrt{\left( v_{ga,x} \right)^2 + \left( v_{ga,y} \right)^2}$
> >
> $|\vec v_{g,a}| = \sqrt{\left( -184.691 \, km/hr \right)^2 + \left( 46.066 \, km/hr \right)^2}$
> >
> $|\vec v_{g,a}| = 190.35 \, km/hr$

Giving me an wind velocity of `190.35 km/hr`


#### Part 2: Angle
To find the angle of a velocity vector $\vec v$, we can use the formula:

$\Theta = \tan^{-1}{\left( \frac{v_y}{v_x} \right)}$

Which we can then apply to this specific instance to find the **uncorrected** wind direction:

$\Theta = \tan^{-1}{\left( \frac{v_{ga,y}}{v_{ga,x}} \right)}$

Now, just plug in the values that we found for the vector $\vec v_{g,a}$

For my example problem, this works out to:
> $\Theta = \tan^{-1}{\left( \frac{v_{ga,y}}{v_{ga,x}} \right)}$
> >
> $\Theta = \tan^{-1}{\left( \frac{
	-46.066 \, km/hr
}{
	184.691 \, km/hr
} \right)}$
>>
> $\Theta = -14.01°$

This angle then needs to be corrected by adding increments of $90°$ in order to account for the limitations in the range of the $\tan^{-1}$ function.

For my example problem:
> the vector $\vec v_{g,a}$ should be in the second ( - , + ) quadrant, so we need to add 180 degrees:
> $\Theta_{found} = \Theta + 180°$
> >
> $\Theta_{found} = -14.0° + 180°$
> >
> $\Theta_{found} = 166°$

Before we finish, we need to convert our answer back into the directional system that the problem gave originally. To do so, we can use the formula:

$\Theta_{original} = 90° - \Theta_{found}$

For my exapmle problem, this works out to:
> $\Theta_{original} = 90° - 166°$
> >
> $\Theta_{original} = -76°$
> 
>>
> To keep it positive, we can add 360 degrees:
> >
> $\Theta_{original} = -76° + 360°$
> >
> $\Theta_{original} = 284°$

Giving me a final solution of `284°`
