## Q1: Force Applied to a Car

### Question:
> The following question refers to a toy car which can move to the right or left along a horizontal line (the positive part of the distance axis). *Assume that friction is so small that it can be ignored.*  

> A force is applied to the car.
Choose the one force graph for the statement below which could allow the described motion of the car to continue.
If you think that none is correct, answer choice “None of these graphs are correct.”  
> **The car moves toward the right (away from the origin) with a steady (constant) velocity.**

> - [ ] None of these graphs are correct

### Steps / Summary

The correct answer in this case is `A`, in which the graph is flat and stays at zero.

While I can't conclusively say what the other versions of this problem were, when solving I recommend you keep in mind the equation:

$F = m \cdot a$

Assuming a non-zero mass, we can take out that constant (since it'd just change the scale of our scale-less graph) to get:

$F \approx a$

For my question:
> Since in my question velocity is `steady (constant)`:  
> $F \approx a$  
> $F \approx 0$  
> Meaning that the following graph is a good approximation for $F$:

This question is fairly subjective, and I don't have enough info to explain all the possibilities well. If you still have questions, ask a friend or send me a message!


## Q2: Force aMovement

### Question:
> When a constant negative net force acts upon an object moving in the negative direction, what happens to the object’s motion?

> Answer Choices:
> - [x] **The object always slows down.**
> - [ ] The acceleration is changing.
> - [ ] There is no acceleration.
> - [ ] The object always speeds up.

### Steps / Summary

This question is similar to the previous, except here we are deriving speed from the acceleration and motion.

Remember that speed = $|\vec v|$

I'm assuming that acceleration is change in speed over time instead of change in velocity over time, since this is the only thing that seems to make sense with the answer choices.

If you're feeling stuck, try drawing out a graph. 
 - Movement
   - If the movement starts as negative, place the $y$-intercept below $0$
   - If there is no initial movement, place the $y$-intercept at $0$
   - If the movement starts as positive, place the $y$-intercept somewhere above $0$
 - Acceleration
   - If the acceleration is negative, slope the line downwards from the $y$-intercept
   - If the acceleration is zero, extend the line directly horizontal from the $y$-intercept
   - If the acceleration is positive, slope the line upwards from the $y$-intercept

Then, take the absolute value of the ensuing graph, and answer based on the slope of the final graph. 
 - Negative - slowing down
 - Flat - no acceleration
 - Positive - speeding up

This is also my interpretation of the question's solutions:

| force | movement | motion               |
|--     |--        |--                    |
|none|*any*| There is no acceleration.    |
| -  |none | The object always speeds up. |
| -  | -   | The object always speeds up. |
| -  | +   | The acceleration is changing?|
| +  |none | The object always speeds up. |
| +  | -   | The acceleration is changing? |
| +  | +   | The object always speeds up. |


## Q3: Tractor Trailer

### Question:
> A tractor and a sledge that the tractor is pulling are accelerating together at the same rate toward the right as shown in the figure below. The tractor has a mass that is greater than the sledge's mass. Select the best response.
> ![Tractor pulling sled](https://i.ibb.co/hszxtyH/Tractor-and-Sledge.png)

> Answer Choices:  
> - [x] The magnitude of the tractor's pulling force upon the sledge is equal to the magnitude of the sledge's pulling force upon the tractor.
> - [ ] Since the tractor and sledge are traveling to the right, the tractor must be pulling on the sledge with a greater force than the sledge pulls on the tractor.
> - [ ] The force of the ground pushing against the propulsive tires of the tractor must be equal and opposite to the frictional force acting upon the sledge.
> - [ ] Since the sledge is accelerating, the tractor must be pulling on it with a force greater than the sledge pulls on the tractor.
> - [ ] Since the tractor is accelerating, the sledge must be pushing on the tractor with a greater force than the tractor is pushing on the sledge.
> - [ ] The tractor must pull on the sledge with a greater force than the sledge pulls on the tractor since the mass of the tractor is greater than the mass of the sledge.
> - [ ] Since the mass of the tractor is greater than the mass of the sledge, the sledge must pull on the tractor with a greater force than the tractor pulls on the sledge.

### Steps / Summary

There's a *lot* of text in this problem, so what you'll probably want to do is think about it and draw out a **free force diagram** first.

To get the first (correct) answer, we can observe that in the reference frame of the tractor, the velocity of the sled is constant (zero, since it's staying attached and moving at the same speed and acceleration).

We can extrapolate from this that the tractor-trailer system must be in equilibrium, meaning that there is a net force of zero. For this to be true, the two tension forces must be equal (trailer on tractor & tractor on trailer), at least in magnitude, with differing direction, as such:

$\vec F_{net} = \vec F_{t,tractor} +  \vec F_{t,trailer}$  
$0 = \vec F_{t,tractor} +  \vec F_{t,trailer}$  
$\vec F_{t,tractor} = -\vec F_{t,trailer}$  
$|\vec F_{t,tractor}| = |\vec F_{t,trailer}|$

Confirming that the magnitudes of the tensions from each part of this system are indeed equal.

## Q4: Space Chimp

### Question:
> A chimpanzee and an astronaut are playing in a large module of the International Space Station, which is in a freefall orbit (uniform circular motion) around the Earth. They are "floating" far away from any of the module's surfaces. The arm strength of the chimpanzee is exactly twice that of the astronaut's. On the other hand, the mass of the astronaut is exactly twice the chimp's. While facing each other, they put their open palms against each other's and push. Select the best response.

> Answer Choices:
> -  [ ] The astronaut pushes with a greater force since his mass is greater, which provides him with a better base of inertia to push from.
> -  [x] **They push on each other with equal force regardless of their masses or arm strengths.**
> -  [ ] Since they are in a freefall orbit and are not in contact with any of the module's surfaces, they cannot exert any pushing force upon each other.
> -  [ ] The chimp exerts a greater force since it has a greater arm strength.
> -  [ ] They push on each other with equal force since the greater arm strength of the chimp is exactly balanced by the greater mass of the astronaut.

### Steps / Summary
Another MCQ question. Ugh. 

Newton's third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction: creating the relationship between the forces two objects exert on each other when they interact.

A force can only be as large as what's pushing back on it. In this system, the only forces are those generated by the chimp and astronaut on each other. Thus, regardless of arm strength or anything else, the forces must be equal. Everything else is a distractor.

*Note: I'm not super sure on this one though. Don't @ me*


## Q5: Wrecking Ball

Saved from the MCQs!! Praise be math finally (kinda)

### Question:
> A $6800 \, N$ wrecking ball hangs from the end of a steel cable. 
> - What is its mass? (in kg)
> - What is the wrecking ball's weight (in N)
> - What is the net force acting on the wrecking ball as it hangs motionless from the end of the cable? (in N)
> - What is the wrecking ball's inertia? (in kg)
> - What is the net force acting on the wrecking ball if the cable snaps? (in N)

### Variable Breakdown
> $W = 6800 \, N$

### Steps / Summary
#### Part 1: Mass
To find the mass, simply use the equation:  
$W = F_g = m*g$  
$W = m*g$  
$m = \frac{W}{g}$

For my example problem this works out to:
> $m = \frac{W}{g}$  
> $m = \frac{6800 \, N}{9.8 \, m/s^2}$  
> $m = 693.9 \, \text{kg}$

Giving me a mass of `694 kg`

#### Part 2: Weight

The weight was given by the question initially

For my problem this would be `6800 N`

*Note that you'll have to write anything in the thousands or beyond as `6.8 * 10^3 N` since `6800 N` is too few sigfigs, and `6800. N` is too many, it wants exactly three sigfigs.* 

#### Part 3: Net Force When Motionless

For this part, remember that in equilibrium, the net force must equal 0, giving us a net force of `0 N` when motionless!

#### Part 4: Inertia

(Non-rotational) Inertia is just mass. You may reuse your answer from ***Part 1***, mine was `694 kg` 

#### Part 5: Net Force After Snap

For this, we recognize the relationship:  
$W = F_g$  
from ***Part 1*** in order to realize that   
$F_{net} = F_g = W$  

Which means that we just reuse our given weight. In my case this is `6800 N`


## Q6: Finding a Planet's Gravity

### Question:
> On some strange planet you find that a $10.4 \, \text{kg}$ object falls downward $9.4 \, \text m$ in $5.2 \, \text s$.
> - What is the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity on this planet? (in m/s^2)
> - How much does the object weigh on this planet? (in N)
> - And, how much would this object weigh back on Earth? (in N)

### Variable Breakdown
> $m = 10.4 \, \text{kg}$  
> $d = -9.4 \, \text m$
> $t = 5.2 \, \text s$

### Steps / Summary
#### Part 1: Gravitational Acceleration
To find the acceleration that the object's undergoing, we can use the equation:

$\Delta y = \vec v_0*t+\frac{1}{2}*\vec a*t^2$  
$\Delta y - \vec v_0*t= +\frac{1}{2}*\vec a*t^2$  
$\frac{\Delta y - \vec v_0*t}{0.5*t^2} = \vec a$  
$|\vec a| = |\frac{\Delta y - v_0*t}{0.5*t^2}|$  

For my example problem this works out to:
> $|\vec a| = |\frac{\Delta y - v_0*t}{0.5*t^2}|$  
> $|\vec a| = |\frac{-9.4 \, \text m - 0 \, \text m}{0.5*(5.2 \, \text s)^2}|$  
> $|\vec a| = |\frac{-9.4 \, \text m - 0 \, \text m}{0.5*(5.2 \, \text s)^2}|$  
> $|\vec a| = 0.694 \, \frac{\text m}{\text s^2}$

Giving me a gravity constant $g_{planet}$ of `0.695 m/s^2`

#### Part 2: Weight on Planet

To find weight, we use the equation:

$W = m*g$  
$W = m*g_{planet}$

For my example problem this works out to:
> $W = m*g_{planet}$  
> $W = (10.4 \, \text{kg})*0.695 \, \frac{\text m}{\text s^2}$  
> $W = 7.23 \, \text N$

Giving me an on-planet weight of `7.23 N`

#### Part 3: Weight on Earth
To find weight, we again use the equation:

$W = m*g$  
$W = m*g_{earth}$

For my example problem this works out to:
> $W = m*g_{planet}$  
> $W = (10.4 \, \text{kg})*9.8 \, \frac{\text m}{\text s^2}$  
> $W = 101.92 \, \text N$

Giving me an on-planet weight of `101.92 N`


## Q7: Normal Force Conceptual

### Question:
> Normal force always points in the vertical direction.

> Answer Choices:
> - [ ] True
> - [x] False

### Summary
Think about our ladder problem from in-class the other day. As long as you're pushing against something, it'll push back. 

If you feel stuck on this, try leaning against a wall. You're applying a force to the wall, and the wall is pushing back against you with another *horizontal* force. Thus, this statement must be false!

## Q8: Tension Force Conceptual

### Question:
> The direction of tension force is always ___

> Answer Choices:
> - [ ] in the direction perpendicular to the string or rope.
> - [x] in the direction of the string or rope.

### Summary
Try holding any long object from both ends. Notice how it works to counteract any changes at its full extension by applying a force opposite to the applied force *along the direction of the object*, since this is how the force is applied to it!
