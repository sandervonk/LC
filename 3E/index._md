## Q1: Hammer throw
### Question
> A hammer thrower whirls a $16.2 \text{kg}$ iron ball on the end of a $0.9 \text{m}$ string at $0.9 \frac{\text{rev}}{\text {s}}$ in a horizontal circle. Calculate the force in the string.

### Variable Breakdown
> $m_{ball} = 16.2 \text{kg}$  
> $r = 0.9 \text{m}$  
> $\omega = 0.9 \frac{\text{rev}}{\text {s}}$

### Steps / Summary
Some nice AP1 review we love to see it
#### Setup
To find the tangential velocity $v$, we can use $v = \omega * c$,  where $c$ is the circumference, since every revolution, the ball will be traversing the entire circumference of its circular path!  

For my example problem, this might look like:
> $v = \omega * c$  
> $v = 0.9 \frac{\text{rev}}{\text {s}} * 2 \pi \frac{\text{rad}}{\text{rev}} * r$  
> $v = 0.9 \frac{\text{rev}}{\text {s}} * 2 \pi \frac{\text{rad}}{\text{rev}} * 0.9 \text{m}$  
> $v \approx 5.09 \frac{\text{m}}{\text {s}}$  

Now that we have our tangential velocity, we can work using the centripetal force. Since our ball has a constant velocity, we know our net force must be 0. Therefore:

$\vec F_{net} = \vec F_c + \vec T$  
$|\vec F_c| = |\vec T|$  

We can then use the equation for centripetal force to find tension:  
$|\vec F_c| = \frac{mv^2}{r}$  
$|\vec T| = |\vec F_c|$  
$|\vec T| = | \frac{mv^2}{r}|$  

For my example problem, this works out to:
> $|\vec T| = | \frac{mv^2}{r}|$  
> $|\vec T| = | \frac{\left( 16.2 \text{kg} \right)\left( 5.09 \frac{\text{m}}{\text {s}} \right)^2}{0.9 \text{m}}|$  
> $|\vec T| = | 466.35 N|$  

Giving me a tension of `466.35 N`

## Q2: Ferry Wheel (more or less)
### Question
> A student of mass $M = 69 \text{kg}$ takes a ride in a frictionless loop-the-loop at an amusement park. The radius of the loop-the-loop is $R = 16 \text {m}$. The force due to the seat on the student at the top of the loop-the-loop is $N = 348 \text {N}$ and is vertically down. 
> - What is the apparent weight of the student at the bottom of the loop-the-loop?

### Variable Breakdown
> $M = 69 \, \text{kg}$  
> $R = 16 \, \text {m}$  
> $N = 348 \, \text {N}$  

### Steps / Summary
In a free body diagram of the seat at the very top of the roller coaster, $\vec W$ points down, and $\vec N$ points upwards with a smaller magnitude. The difference between these two magnitudes needed to make a $\vec F_{net} = 0 \, \text{N}$ system is $F_c$, the centripetal force. We can assert that:

$\vec W = \vec N + \vec F_c$

And calculate the normal force $\vec N_{top}$ as:

$\vec N = \vec W - \vec F_c$
