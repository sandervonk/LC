## Q1: Hammer throw
### Question
> A hammer thrower whirls a $16.2 \text{kg}$ iron ball on the end of a $0.9 \text{m}$ string at $0.9 \frac{\text{rev}}{\text {s}}$ in a horizontal circle. Calculate the force in the string.

### Variable Breakdown
> $m_{ball} = 16.2 \text{kg}$  
> $r = 0.9 \text{m}$  
> $\omega = 0.9 \frac{\text{rev}}{\text {s}}$

### Steps / Summary
Some nice AP1 review we love to see it
#### Setup
To find the tangential velocity $v$, we can use $v = \omega * c$,  where $c$ is the circumference, since every revolution, the ball will be traversing the entire circumference of its circular path!  

For my example problem, this might look like:
> $v = \omega * c$  
> $v = 0.9 \frac{\text{rev}}{\text {s}} * 2 \pi \frac{\text{rad}}{\text{rev}} * r$  
> $v = 0.9 \frac{\text{rev}}{\text {s}} * 2 \pi \frac{\text{rad}}{\text{rev}} * 0.9 \text{m}$  
> $v \approx 5.09 \frac{\text{m}}{\text {s}}$  

Now that we have our tangential velocity, we can work using the centripetal force. Since our ball has a constant velocity, we know our net force must be 0. Therefore:

$\vec F_{net} = \vec F_c + \vec T$  
$|\vec F_c| = |\vec T|$  

We can then use the equation for centripetal force to find tension:  
$|\vec F_c| = \frac{mv^2}{r}$  
$|\vec T| = |\vec F_c|$  
$|\vec T| = | \frac{mv^2}{r}|$  

For my example problem, this works out to:
> $|\vec T| = | \frac{mv^2}{r}|$  
> $|\vec T| = | \frac{\left( 16.2 \text{kg} \right)\left( 5.09 \frac{\text{m}}{\text {s}} \right)^2}{0.9 \text{m}}|$  
> $|\vec T| = | 466.35 N|$  

Giving me a tension of `466.35 N`

## Q2: Ferry Wheel (more or less)
### Question
> A student of mass $M = 69 \text{kg}$ takes a ride in a frictionless loop-the-loop at an amusement park. The radius of the loop-the-loop is $R = 16 \text {m}$. The force due to the seat on the student at the top of the loop-the-loop is $N = 348 \text {N}$ and is vertically down. 
> - What is the apparent weight of the student at the bottom of the loop-the-loop?

### Variable Breakdown
> $M = 69 \, \text{kg}$  
> $R = 16 \, \text {m}$ (useless)  
> $N = 348 \, \text {N}$  

### Steps / Summary
#### Finding the initial condition
At the very top of the roller coaster, the normal force is directly downward. To find the velocity of the roller coaster at this point we can use the definition of centrifugal force based on the net forces, with downwards gravitational and normal forces, and upwards centri**fugal** force;

$F_{net} = 0$  
$F_{net} = -W + F_c - N$  
$F_{cf} = W + N$  

Then, knowing that centri**petal** force has the same magnitude as the centri**fugal** force just with the opposite direction, we can apply the definition:

$F_{cf} = W + N$  

$F_{cf} = F_{cp}$  
$F_{cp} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$  
$F_{cf} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$  

$W + N = \frac{mv^2}{r}$  
$\frac{m}{r} \cdot \left( W + N \right) = v^2$  
$v = \sqrt{\frac{m\left( W + N \right)}{r}}$  

##### Using Energy
Now this is where it gets fun. We can use the mechanical energy formulas we used in AP 1 to solve;
###### Kinetic Energy
$K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
###### (Gravitational) Potential Energy
$U = mgh$
###### Total Mechanical Energy
$E = K + U$  

And then use the concept of conservation of energy to assert that  
$E_i = E_f$  
$K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f$  
$\left( \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 \right) + \left( mgh_i \right) = \left( \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 \right) + \left( mgh_f \right)$  
$\frac{1}{2}v_i^2 + gh_i = \left( \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 \right) + \left( mgh_f \right)$  

## Q3: Escaping Roller Coaster Car
### Question:
> The summit of a roller coaster has the shape of a circle with a radius of $12.0 \, \text{m}$. 
> What is the maximum speed a single car, of mass $480 \, \text{kg}$, can have at the summit if it is not to leave the track?

### Variable Breakdown
> $r = 12.0 \, \text{m}$  
> $m = 480 \, \text{kg}$
