## LC4B-1
### Question Text
> A ball of mass 1.8 kg hangs at the end of a string 1.5 m in length from the ceiling of a room. The height of the room is 3.7 m. 

> What is the gravitational potential energy of the ball relative to the ceiling?
(in J) **-2.65×10^1 J**

> What is the gravitational potential energy of the ball relative to the floor?
(in J) **3.88×10^1 J**

> What is the gravitational potential energy (in J) of the ball relative to a point at the same elevation as the ball?
(in J) **0.00 J**

### Summary
$U_g = mgh$

$U_g = mg*\Delta y$

for the first part, $\Delta y$ is the negative distance from the ball to the ceiling (the displacement of the ball from the ceiling)

for the second part, the $\Delta y$ is the displacement from the ball to the floor (distance from the ceiling to the floor minus the length of the string)

for the last part, $\Delta y$ is 0

## LC4B-2
### Question Text
> A 2 kg mass attached to a spring passes its equilibrium point moving at 390 m/s. If the spring constant is 1250 N/m, what is the maximum displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position? (in m) **15.60 m**

### Summary
$U_s + U_k = 0$

$U_s = -U_k$

$0.5*x^2*k = 0.5*m*v^2$

$0.5*x^2*1250 = 0.5*2*390^2$

$x = \sqrt{0.5*2*390^2/(0.5*1250)}$

$x = 15.6$


## LC4B-3
### Question Text
> For the roller coaster track pictured below, x = 20.0 m. A loaded 548 kg roller coaster cart has 1.0259×10^5 J of kinetic energy at point X, and 1.9120×10^5 J of KE at point Y.

> What is the total mechanical energy at point X? (in J) **210000.00 J**

>What is the total mechanical energy at point Y? (in J) **210000.00 J**

> What is the height of the track at point Y? (in m) **3.50 m**

### Summary
TME at X:

$E = U_g + K$

$E = 20.0*9.8*548 + 1.0259*10^5$

$E = 210000.00 J$ (use scientific form 
for 3 sigfigs)

------

TME stays constant, therefore the 
same at $Y = 2.10*10^5$ again

---

TME is constant, therefore:

$E_i = E_f$

$U_gi + K_i = U_gf + K_f$

$20.0*9.8*548 + 1.0259e5 = h*548*9.8 + 1.9120e5$

$h = (20.0*9.8*548 + 1.0259e5 - 
1.9120e5) / (9.8*548)$

$h = 3.50 \text m$


## LC4B-4
### Question Text
> A man skis down from the top of a hill 1000.0 m high, starting from rest. If he loses 70% of his initial mechanical energy to friction during his descent, what is his speed in m/s at the base of the hill?
(in m/s) **7.67×10^1 m/s**

### Summary
$E_f = (1-0.7)*E_i$

$E_f = 0.3*E_i$

$U_g*0.3 = K$

$mgh*0.3 = 0.5*m*v^2$

$gh*0.3 = 0.5*v^2$

$gh*0.6 = v^2$

$v = \sqrt{gh*0.6}$

$v = \sqrt{1000*9.8*0.6}$


## LC4B-5
### Question Text
> A 2390-kg car starts from rest at the top of a driveway 5.43 m long that is sloped at 20.72o with the horizontal. If an average friction force of 3930 N impedes the motion, what is the speed of the car at the bottom of the driveway?
(in m/s) **4.45 m/s**

### Summary
$E_i = E_f + W'$

$W' = F_f*d$

$W' = 3930*5.42$

$mgh = 0.5*m*v^2 + W'$

$m*g*(h*\sin{\theta}) = 0.5*m*v^2 + 
F_f*d$


$2390*9.8*(5.43*\sin{(20.72\degree)}) = 
0.5*2390*v^2 + 
3930*5.42$

$v^2 = (2390*9.8*(5.43*\sin{(20.72\degree)}) - 3930*5.42)/(0.5*2390)$




## LC4B-6
### Question Text
> A moving 4.0 kg block collides with a horizontal spring whose spring constant is 381 N/m (see figure). The block compresses the spring a maximum distance of 9.5 cm from its rest position. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the horizontal surface is 0.50. 

> What is the work done by the spring in bringing the block to rest? **-1.72 J**

> How much mechanical energy is being dissipated by the force of friction while the block is being brought to rest by the spring? **1.86 J**

> What is the speed of the block when it hits the spring? **1.34 m/s**

### Summary
$E_i - (E_f + W') = 0$

$E_i = E_f + W'$

$E_i = E_f + W_f$

$E_i = E_f + F_f*d$

$K_i = U_s + mg*(\mu_k)*d$

$0.5*m*v^2 = 0.5*k*x^2 + mg*(\mu_k)*d$

$0.5*m*v^2 = 0.5*k*d^2 + mg*(\mu_k)*d$

---

$W_s = -U_s = -0.5*k*d^2$

$W_s = -0.5*381*(0.095^2)$

---

$W' = W_f = mg*(\mu_k)*d$

$W_f = 4.0*9.8*0.5*0.095$

---

$0.5*m*v^2 = 0.5*k*d^2 + mg*(\mu_k)*d$

$0.5*4.0*v^2 = 0.5*381*(0.095^2) + 
4.0*9.8*0.5*0.095$

$v = \sqrt{(0.5*381*(0.095^2) + 
4.0*9.8*0.5*0.095) / (0.5*4.0)}$
