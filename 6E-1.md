> **Question:** A *2029* kg Oldsmobile traveling east on Saginaw Street at *13.0* m/s is unable to stop on the ice covered intersection for a red light at Abbott Road. The car collides with a *3928* kg truck hauling animal feed north on Abbott at *9.3* m/s. The two vehicles remain locked together after the impact. Calculate the velocity of the wreckage immediately after the impact. Give the speed for your first answer and the compass heading for your second answer. (remember, the CAPA abbreviation for degrees is deg)

## Finding Momenteum:
p_c = 2029 kg * 13 m/s (east)

p_t = 3928 kg * 9.3 m/s (north)

## Velocity - East:

p_f_e = p_c

m_f_e * v_f_e = p_c 

v_f_e = p_c / m_f

v_f_e = (2029 kg * 13 m/s) / (2029 
kg + 3928 kg) 

`v_f_e = 4.4279 m/s`

## Velocity - North:
> same process as East
p_f_n = p_t

v_f_n = p_t / m_f

v_f_n = (3928 kg * 9.3 m/s) / (2029 
kg + 3928 kg) 

`v_f_n = 6.1323 m/s`

## Total:

### Finding the velocity:
v_f_e = 4.4279 m/s
v_f_n = 6.1323 m/s

> We can also think of this as

v_x = 4.4279 m/s
v_y = 6.1323 m/s

> we can find the velocity by solving the triangle w/ Pythagorean:

v = sqrt(v_x^2 + v_y^2)

v = sqrt((4.4279 m/s)^2 + (6.1323 
m/s)^2)

`v = 7.5638 m/s`

### Finding the angle
> we can use a bit of trig to find the angle

> use inverse tangent, since we know the opposite and adjacent sides, to find the interior angle.

> **you may need to check the sign and if it's offset by increments of 90deg and such, as a result of using trig, (many triangles have these side lengths, just all with different orientations)**

tan(theta) = o / a

theta = atan(o / a)

theta = atan(v_y / v_x)

theta = atan((6.1323 m/s) / (4.4279 
m/s))

theta = 54.168 deg

> since it starts at the vertical and increases going clockwise (see the "LC6E Read Me!"), we'll need to fix our theta

theta = 90 deg - theta_i

theta = 90 deg - 54.168 deg

`theta = 35.832 deg`

## Final Solutions

`v = 7.5638 m/s`

`theta = 35.832 deg`



## Extended: Full Equations

> Using the above, we can generate an equation to get both answers from the provided numbers

#### Before we start, some notes:

> *note that non-positive compass headings (south, west) may require some tweaking before using the equations*

> *note that the angle equation may not work for all questions, but I hope you arent solving this way regardless so it shouldn't matter... right?*

### Velocity:

v = $\sqrt{\left(\frac{m_c \cdot v_c}{m_c + m_t }\right)^2 + \left(\frac{m_t \cdot v_t}{m_t + m_c }\right)^2}$

> Example: 
> v = $\sqrt{\left(\frac{2029kg \cdot 13\frac{m}{s}}{2023kg + 3928kg }\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3928kg \cdot 9.3\frac{m}{s}}{3928kg + 2023kg }\right)^2}$ 
> v =  $7.57149 \frac{m}{s}$

### Angle:
$\theta$ = $\arctan{\frac{\left( \frac{m_t \cdot v_t}{m_t + m_c }\right)}{\left(\frac{m_c \cdot v_c}{m_c + m_t }\right)}}$

> Example: 
> $\theta$ = $\arctan{\frac{\left(\frac{2029kg \cdot 13\frac{m}{s}}{2023kg + 3928kg }\right)}{\left(\frac{3928kg \cdot 9.3\frac{m}{s}}{3928kg + 2023kg }\right)}}$
> $\theta$ = $35.83 \degree$
> 
> corrections (may vary):
> * *none in this case*
