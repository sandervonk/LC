# Lon Capa 6E - Question 2 | 2-D Explosion

> **Question:** Explosives are used to blow a rock apart. The explosion blows the rock into three fragments. Two fragments go off at a *111* degree angle to each other--a *4.2* kg piece at *21.4* m/s and a *3.1* kg piece at *32.8* m/s. Calculate the speed of the third piece, if it has a mass of *4.3* kg.

> m_1 = 4.2 kg
> v_1 = 21.4 m/s
>
> m_2 = 3.1 kg
> v_2 = 32.8 m/s
>
> m_3 = 4.3 kg

> ~Believe it or not, a lot of this data isn't even needed. We can use the momenteum concepts to solve it! I'll go through the process with two of the different peices to check anyways though.~

## Finding Momentum

> p = m * v

### Using the first fragment

p_1 = m_1 * v_1

p_1 = 4.2 kg * 21.4 m/s

p_1 = 89.88 N*s

### Using the second fragment

p_2 = m_2 * v_2

p_2 = 3.1 kg * 32.8 m/s

p_2 = 101.68 N*s
