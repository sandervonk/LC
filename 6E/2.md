# Lon Capa 6E - Question 2 | 2-D Explosion

> **Question:** Explosives are used to blow a rock apart. The explosion blows the rock into three fragments. Two fragments go off at a *111* degree angle to each other--a *4.2* kg piece at *21.4* m/s and a *3.1* kg piece at *32.8* m/s. Calculate the speed of the third piece, if it has a mass of *4.3* kg.
> 
> $m_1$= 4.2 kg 
> $v_1$ = 21.4 m/s
> 
> $m_2$ = 3.1 kg
> $v_2$ = 32.8 m/s
> 
> $m_3$ = 4.3 kg
> 
> $\theta$ =  111 degrees

## Finding momentums(s)
### Core Concepts
> We're solving for: v_3. To do so, we'll rely on our previous knowledge that an explosion will result in a net momentum of 0 in every dimension (absent gravity et al)
> 
$$p = 0$$
> so we can apply this to the components of the magnitude to create two new equations

$$\begin{aligned}
p_x =& \ 0 \\ p_y =& \ 0
\end{aligned}$$

> keep these in mind, we'll be using them after finding the existing momentums!

### Finding existing fragment momentums: Fragment 1
> since we have no real idea of where this is in space, and it ultimately doesn't matter to the solution, we can call the direction of the first fragment the x-axis, and $\theta = 0$ (based on the unit circle)
> 
> This makes this part fairly easy, since it only has one direction, but we'll set up both components just to be thorough

> Using the momentum equation:
> $p = m * v$
> we can create equations for the two. note that $\theta$ = 0, and $\sin(0) = 0$, so there is no y-component, or it is equal to 0, however you want to think about it

$$\begin{aligned}
p_{1,x} =& \ v_1 * m_1 * \cos(\theta) \\ p_{1,y} =& \ v_1 * m_1 * \sin(\theta)
\end{aligned}$$

> which at $\theta = 0$ just becomes

$$\begin{aligned}
p_{1,x} =& \ v_1 * m_1 
\\ 
p_{1,y} =& \ 0 
\end{aligned}$$

### Finding existing fragment momentums: Fragment 2
> We can use the equations from the previous question to rewrite write some equations for the second fragment, angled at an angle $\theta$ away from the first fragment. We can simply reuse the equations, however now $\theta$ is set equal to the value we are given in the problem

$$\begin{aligned}
p_{2,x} =& \ v_2 * m_2 * \cos(\theta) \\ p_{2,y} =& \ v_2 * m_2 * \sin(\theta)
\end{aligned}$$

### Combining existing fragments to find the third
> Note: I recommend calculating these values in-between steps to avoid having such long equations

> since we know 
$$\begin{aligned}
p_x =& \ 0 \\ p_y =& \ 0
> \\
> p_{direction} =& \sum{p_{direction, each}}\end{aligned}$$

> we can create new equations and set them equal to their 0 values from before because of what we know about explosions and momentum

$$\begin{aligned}
0 =& \ p_{1,x} + p_{2,x} + p_{3,x}
\\
 0 =& \ p_{1,y} + p_{2,y} + p_{3,y}
\end{aligned}$$

> now we can substitute in our values from before

$$\begin{aligned}
0 =& \ (v_1 * m_1 ) \ &+ \ (v_2 * m_2 * \cos(\theta)) \ +& \ p_{3, x}
\\
 0 =& \ 0 \ &+ \ (v_2 * m_2 * \sin(\theta)) \ +& \ p_{3, y}
\end{aligned}$$

> now let's do a bit of expanding and isolate the $p_3$ values

$$\begin{aligned}
m_3 * v_{3, x}& = -(v_1 * m_1 )  \ - &(v_2 * m_2 * \cos(\theta))
\\
m_3 * v_{3, y}& = &(v_2 * m_2 * \sin(\theta))
\end{aligned}$$

> finally, let's isolate the velocities

$$\begin{aligned}
v_{3, x}& = \frac{-(v_1 * m_1 ) -(v_2 * m_2 * \cos(\theta))}{m_3}
\\
v_{3, y}& = \frac{(v_2 * m_2 * \sin(\theta))}{m_3}
\end{aligned}$$

> We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find speed from the two velocity components, substituting in the values that we

$$\begin{aligned}
v_3 =& \ \sqrt{(v_{3,x})^2 + (v_{3,y})^2}
\\
v_3 =& \ \sqrt{\left(
\frac{-(v_1 * m_1 ) -(v_2 * m_2 * \cos(\theta))}{m_3}
\right)^2 + \left(\frac{(v_2 * m_2 * \sin(\theta))}{m_3}\right)^2}
\end{aligned}$$

> That's all! your $v_3$ (which is really the magnitude of $v_3$) is the answer you just found above
>
>For my question: it was

$v_3$= `25.3337 m/s`


# Final Equations
> Note: Take these with a grain of salt, it's much better to follow along with the steps in sections above, and that way you'll yk.. learn, too!

$v_3 = \ \sqrt{\left(
\frac{-(v_1 * m_1 ) -(v_2 * m_2 * \cos(\theta))}{m_3}
\right)^2 + \left(\frac{v_2 * m_2 * \sin(\theta)}{m_3}\right)^2}$
