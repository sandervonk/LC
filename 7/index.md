## Questions

### Question 1

---

#### Question:

> ![Question Image](https://i.ibb.co/5GdXPkQ/image.png)
> Two uniform identical solid spherical balls each of mass M, radius R, and moment of inertia about its center $\frac{2}{5} M R^2$ , are released from rest from the same height h above the horizontal ground. Ball A falls straight down, while ball B rolls down the distance x along the inclined plane without slipping. If the velocity of the ball A as it hits the ground is VA, the velocity VB of Ball B as it reaches the ground would be:
>
> A. $0.5 \cdot V_A$
> B. $0.85 \cdot V_A$
> C. $1.0 \cdot V_A$
> D. $1.2 \cdot V_A$

#### Solving

We'll only need to a few equations for this one, but they're pretty important!

> Angular Kinetic Energy
> $$K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2}I ω^2$$

> Linear Kinetic Energy
> $$K_{\text{linear}} = \frac{1}{2}m v^2$$

> Gravitational Potential Energy
> $$ΔU_{\text{g}} = m g h$$

And a basic concept:

> Conservation of Energy
> $$E_{\text{i}} = E_{\text{f}}$$

Based on this, we can write out equations for the two parts of the problem

For the ball that is simply falling:

> $$
> \begin{align}
> E_{\text{i}} &= E_{\text{f}} \\
> ΔU_{\text{g}} &= K_{\text{linear}}  \\
> m g h &= \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\
> 2 g h &= v^2 \\
> {V_A}^2 &= 2 g h
> \end{align}
> $$

For the other ball, it's a bit more complicated, because it has both linear and rotational kinetic energy, but with the help of

> $$ω = \frac{v}{r}$$

and

> $$I = \frac{2}{5} m r^2$$

we can make significant headway, though we start the same way as the other question. Note however that we're looking to create an expression equal to what we found in the first one ($2gh$), so that we can set them equal and solve!

> $$
> \begin{align}
> E_{\text{i}} &= E_{\text{f}} \\
> ΔU_{\text{g}} &= K_{\text{linear}}  + K_{\text{rot}}  \\
> mgh &= \frac{1}{2} m v^2 + \frac{1}{2} I ω^2 \\
> mgh &= \frac{1}{2} m v^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{2}{5} m r^2 \right) \left( \frac{v}{r} \right)^2 \\
> mgh &= \frac{1}{2} m v^2 + \frac{2}{10} m r^2 \frac{v^2}{r^2} \\
> mgh &= \frac{1}{2} m v^2 + \frac{2}{10} m v^2 \\
> gh &= \frac{1}{2} v^2 + \frac{2}{10} v^2 \\
> 2gh &= \frac{7}{5} v^2 \\
> 2gh &= \frac{7}{5} {V_B}^2 \\
> \end{align}
> $$

now given these two equations for $V_A$ and $V_B$, we can set them equal and solve for what the question is asking for: $V_B$ in terms of $V_A$, aka $V_B$

$$
\begin{align}
2 g h &= 2gh \\
{V_A}^2 &= \frac{7}{5} {V_B}^2 \\
\frac{5}{7} {V_A}^2 &= {V_B}^2 \\
\sqrt{\frac{5}{7} {V_A}^2} &= V_B \\
\sqrt{\frac{5}{7}} * \sqrt{{V_A}^2} &= V_B \\
\sqrt{\frac{5}{7}} * V_A &= V_B \\
V_B &= \sqrt{\frac{5}{7}} \cdot V_A \\
V_B &= 0.845154 \cdot V_A \\
V_B &\approx 0.85 \cdot V_A
\end{align}
$$

#### Answer (B)

$$0.85 \cdot V_A$$

### Question 2

#### Question:

> The MKS units of torque are the same as those of:
>
> A. Angular momentum
> B. Kinetic Energy
> C. Rotational inertia
> D. Linear momentum

#### Solving / Reasoning

First, we need to find out the actual units of torque!

> **Torque**
>
> $$
> \begin{align}
> τ &= F r ⋅ sin(θ) \\
> τ &= (m a) r ⋅ sin(θ) \\
> τ &= \left( kg ⋅ \frac{m}{s^2} \right) ⋅ m \\
> τ &= \frac{kg ⋅ m^2}{s^2}
> \end{align}
> $$

so this is what things will need to match ($N ⋅ m$)

There's no real way to "solve" this question, but we can go through the different options and work through them in terms of their SI units

> **Angular momentum** (no)
>
> $$
> \begin{align}
> L &= m v r \\
> L &= kg ⋅ \frac{m}{s} ⋅ m \\
> L &= \frac{kg ⋅ m^2}{s}
> \end{align}
> $$
>
> ---
>
> $$
> \begin{align}
> L &= I ω \\
> L &= \left( kg ⋅ m^2 \right) ⋅ \frac{rad}{s} \\
> L &= \frac{kg ⋅ m^2 ⋅ rad}{s} \\
> L &= \frac{kg ⋅ m^2 }{s} \\
> \end{align}
> $$
>
> ---
>
> $$
> \begin{align}
> L &= r p \\
> L &= m ⋅ \left( kg ⋅ \frac{m}{s} \right) \\
> L &=  \frac{kg ⋅ m^2}{s}
> \end{align}
> $$

> **Kinetic Energy** (yes)
>
> $$
> \begin{align}
> K &= m v^2 \\
> K &= kg ⋅ \left( \frac{m}{s} \right)^2 \\
> K &= \frac{kg ⋅ m^2}{s^2}
> \end{align}
> $$

> **Rotational inertia** (no)
>
> $$
> \begin{align}
> I &= k ⋅ \left( mr^2 \right) \\
> I &= mr^2 \\
> I &= kg ⋅ m^2 \\
> \end{align}
> $$

> **Linear momentum** (no)
>
> $$
> \begin{align}
> p &= mv \\
> p &= kg ⋅ \frac{m}{s} \\
> p &= \frac{kg ⋅ m}{s} \\
> \end{align}
> $$

#### Answer

$$\text{Kinetic Energy}$$

### Question 3

---

#### Question:

> A skater is spinning on ice with her arms outstretched about the vertical axis at an angular speed of ω. When she brings her arms close to her body, which of the following statements is correct?
>
> A. Her angular velocity and angular momentum remain constant
> B. Her angular momentum is increased
> C. Her kinetic energy is increased
> D. Her kinetic energy is decreased

#### Reasoning:

> **Her angular velocity and angular momentum remain constant** (no)

> **Her angular momentum is increased** (no)

> **Her kinetic energy is increased** (yes)
>
> Work is preformed by pulling the weights in, adding to the kinetic energy of the weights, which by itself otherwise stays constant

> **Her kinetic energy is decreased** (no)

#### Answer:

$$\text{Her kinetic energy is increased}$$
